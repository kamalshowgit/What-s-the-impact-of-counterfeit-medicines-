# Counterfeit Medicines Sales Prediction

## Overview

Counterfeit medicines are a significant global problem that not only affects the economy but also poses serious health risks to people. This project aims to predict sales figures for counterfeit medicine selling operations using machine learning techniques. By accurately predicting sales, law enforcement and regulatory agencies can allocate resources more effectively to target high-net-worth illegal operations, ultimately contributing to the fight against counterfeit medicines.

## Problem Statement

Approximately 10% of the world's medicine supply is estimated to be counterfeit, with even higher rates in developing countries. Criminal networks engage in the illicit trade of counterfeit drugs, generating substantial profits. The collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) highlights the severity of this issue. Despite efforts, new counterfeit medicine selling operations continue to emerge, making resource allocation a challenge.

## Datasets

The project provides two datasets for analysis:

- `counterfeit_train.csv`: This dataset is meant for training your predictive model. It contains various features related to counterfeit medicine selling operations, including attributes that characterize the operations.

- `counterfeit_test.csv`: This dataset is meant for evaluating your model's performance. It lacks the response column, and your task is to predict the sales figures for these operations. You will need to submit your predictions in a CSV file format.

## Approach

To tackle this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Explore the provided datasets, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features that can contribute to predicting sales figures effectively.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. Consider algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.

4. **Model Training**: Train your selected models on the training dataset and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) on the test dataset to understand their predictive capabilities.

6. **Submission**: Use the trained model to predict sales figures for the test dataset. Create a CSV file with your predictions and submit it.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
